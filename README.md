# slks-challenge-archive
A repository for archiving challenges made by me as a part of introduction to CTFs (2021)


I originally made these into a series on the IITB Discord server as a part of engagement in CTF activities. Challenges are easy, simple forensics and some audiogram readings. Thanks to everyone who participated and discussed the problems!
